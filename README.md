# CSC 203 Cal Poly

This is the organization for CSC 203 at Cal Poly.

If you're seeing this, I assume you're an instructor (and member of the organization).
The organization contains a bunch of PUBLIC and PRIVATE repos.

## Public repos

- [live-coding-demos](https://github.com/csc203-calpoly/live-coding-demos/): Code examples to use while live-coding or as lecture examples, if you wish.
- [lecture-notes](https://github.com/csc203-calpoly/lecture-notes): Source for the lecture notes hosted [here](https://csc203-calpoly.github.io/lecture-notes/).

## Private repos

Each lab assignment will have two repositories associated with it. For example, if the lab topic is `interfaces`, you will see

* `STARTER-CODE-lab-interfaces`
* `SOLUTION-lab-interfaces`

The lab names don't have numbers â€“ you should organize them according to your schedule however you see fit.

Similarly, projects will have `STARTER-CODE` and `SOLUTION` repositories.
